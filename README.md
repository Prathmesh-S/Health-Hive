**About Us: 
Health Hive acts as an all-encompassing database for all of your healthcare needs. This software monitors a patient's vitals, making the information easy to navigate and understand, whether it be for their own knowledge, a family member, or a healthcare professional. By allowing users to store medical records, including prescriptions, results, and vaccination history, we provide a variety of health resources/records to the user. This makes Health Hive an essential tool for each user and their wellness!**

**Technologies/Programs used include: GitHub, Figma, Convex, Ngrok, Clerk, Squarespace, Facebook Messenger App, Dropbox, and VS Code Space Liveshare.**
**See the tutorial at [this YouTube link](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1096872920304849066/1097191632819990590) for instructions.**

How we built it: Our team created an entire prototype of Health Hive on Figma. Then, using Convex and Clerk, we created a [demo website](https://3400-129-170-194-144.ngrok-free.app/). Clerk would normally make a local website, but using Ngrok, we were able to make it public. From this demo website, we redirect the user to our [modern website](https://rust-whale-ams4.squarespace.com/), filled with information and resources for the user. This website uses a custom DropBox code injection to accept medical files from the user that can be saved to the cloud for safe-keeping. In addition, our team integrated a custom Facebook Messenger Chatbox that can communicate with the User and answer their questions.

Inspiration:
Being able to understand your health report shouldn’t be as difficult as it is. Being able to properly communicate and identify the different elements of one’s vitals whether it be for themself, a healthcare worker, or a loved one is essential. This also allows nurses to track each patient at the tips of their fingers, being able to see what vitals each patient has and or if they need any assistance.

Accomplishments that we’re proud of:
As a team, we all learned a tremendous amount working with new technologies. We are proud of the fact that we used Figma for the first time, producing an app entirely by ourselves on this platform. We are also proud to be able to securely implement chatbot into our website. We were also able to create a successful spot for patients to upload medical files and it be sent to their healthcare professional. Another accomplishment we were proud of was being able to make the logo and give our app life. 

What we learned:
We all learned different software such as figma, convex, squarespace, etc. in order to complete our project. We were also pushed to work closely together in order to make sure everything in the hive flows correctly. Not only are the skills we’ve learned useful for hackathons, they are transferable to other aspects of code that we may partake in.

What’s next:
We would like to see Health Hive come into fruition as we feel that there is a global impact and there is no other holistic program out there like at this time. We feel as though this software is of extreme value to all, no matter your specific use for Health Hive. In addition to this, we would love to build upon the website and implement location services. These services would be tasked with finding local pharmacies carrying a user’s necessary medication, expanding the Hive and its services even more.
